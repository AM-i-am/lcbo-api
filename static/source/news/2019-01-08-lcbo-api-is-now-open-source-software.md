Hello everyone!

My-oh-my have things changed since my last update a month ago in November!

- Shortly after that post, my lymphoma symptoms started to return and I found out that my [lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma) is still active, considered aggressively refractory
- **[I released LCBO API as open source software](https://github.com/heycarsten/lcbo-api)**
- I will be undergoing immunotherapy ([Yescarta](https://yescarta.com)) as a third-line treatment at [Roswell Park](https://www.roswellpark.org) in [Buffalo, NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York)
- My [treatment plan](https://twitter.com/heycarsten/status/1082630102003998721) begins on January 15th, 2019 (the same day I was planning to turn off LCBO API)

The service is currently hosted on [Linode](https://linode.com), has been since 2009. Linode prorates for the month of usage. Since I will be undergoing T-cell harvest on the 15th I won’t be turning it off that day. I will however be shutting it down by the end of January.

> Please plan to discontinue using LCBO API on January 15th, but service will continue for a few days after that.

I’m also very open to bringing the project back up again! I can no longer personally cover this burden, I can not singlehandedly support and maintain it anymore, I’d love to be a part of it though, and I have lots of ideas.

I have been trying to get corporate sponsors without much luck. I reached out to Heroku, Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure, this sort of stuff takes time though. I am positive that something will connect in the coming months.

I’ll be sure to keep everyone updated as things develop. If you wish you can follow me and LCBO API on Twitter, I update fairly frequently:

- [@lcboapi](https://twitter.com/lcboapi)

Take care, everyone!
