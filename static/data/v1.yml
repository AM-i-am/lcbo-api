    # Welcome to LCBO API

    This is the documentation for Version 1 (V1) of LCBO API. It was originally
    released **April 2009**.

    # Responses

    The default response format for the API is JSON `application/json`. This means that you don't
    need to specify JSON in an `Accept` header or as an extension (.json) if
    that is the format you intend to request. Every response from the API is
    wrapped in a "container" that in its most basic form looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "status": 200,
      "message": null,
      "result": ...
    }
    ```

    This allows the API to return meta information along with the data you are
    requesting. For example, in the case of a
    [Stores with Product](/docs/stores-with-product) request the product object
    is returned with list of stores so that your application does not need to
    perform an additional request to obtain store information.

- anchor: 'authentication'
  title: 'Authentication'
  body: |
    # Authentication

    **LCBO API V1 does not require authentication for access.** Starting on
    <b>March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2015</b>, LCBO API V1 **will** require Access Keys
    for **unlimited** use. New features in LCBO API V1 such as HTTPS and CORS
    **require authentication** with an Access Key.

    <p class="info">
      You can provision an unlimited number of Access Keys for free by
      <a href="/sign-up">creating</a> an LCBO API account.
    </p>

    There are three different types of access keys, they have specific
    use-cases in mind:

    <table class="auth-keys-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th width="22%">Key Type</th>
          <th width="78%">Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td width="22%">
            <b>Web Browser</b>
          </td>
          <td width="78%">
            Use when LCBO API is accessed from a web browser through
            <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (Ajax/XHR)
            using CORS or through dynamically inserted <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
            tags (JSONP). These keys are rate-limited per client IP address and
            are paired to a domain. For example, a Web Browser Access Key with
            the domain <b>momsandhops.ca</b> would fail to work if used
            on a page served from <b>thebeerstore.ca</b>.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="22%">
            <b>Native Client</b>
          </td>
          <td width="78%">
            In native mobile and desktop applications, these keys are rate-limited per
            client but do not support CORS or JSONP.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="22%">
            <b>Private</b>
          </td>
          <td width="78%">
            When LCBO API is accessed from a web server or private script, these keys are not rate-limited, and they do not support CORS or JSONP.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    # JSONP & CORS

    LCBO API provides support for cross-origin requests so that you can access
    LCBO API data directly from a web page. Classically, due to the
    Single Origin Policy there were only two ways to do this, either by
    proxying all requests through an endpoint on your origin server. For
    example, by providing an endpoint like this:

    ```
    mysite.com/lcboapi/*
    ```

    That would then proxy anything after lcboapi/ to lcboapi.com:

    ```
    mysite.com/lcboapi/products -> lcboapi.com/products
    ```

    The proxying approach is actually pretty good, the browser allows these
    requests because they happen on the same domain that the page was served
    from. It does, however, require infrastructure to work, and is pretty
    redundant. This leads us to the first (and until recently, only) way to
    request data from cross-origin servers, JSONP.

    ## JSONP

    JSONP stands for JSON with Padding and works by appending a `<script>` tag
    to the page which points to an LCBO API endpoint with a query parameter
    named `callback`. When LCBO API sees this parameter, it wraps the response
    payload in a JavaScript function call with the name provided
    in the `callback` parameter.

    <p class="orly">
      If it feels like a hack&hellip; that's because it is. JSONP only
      works because the client (you) and the server (LCBO API) agree
      to exploit the browser together.
    </p>

    To use JSONP with LCBO API, simply add a <code>callback</code> parameter
    to LCBO API URLs.

    When using JSONP LCBO API also sets `Content-Type` to
    `application/javascript` since the response is now, actually, executable
    JavaScript.

    For example, this URL `lcboapi.com/products?callback=loadJSON` would return
    a response that looks like:

    ```javascript
    loadJSON({
      status: 200,
      message: null,
      result: [ ... ]
    });
    ```

    It's important to note that most popular JavaScript libraries have built-in
    support for JSONP. For example, the following jQuery can be used to perform
    a JSONP request against LCBO API:

    ```javascript
    $.ajax({
      url: 'http://lcboapi.com/products/371906',
      dataType: 'jsonp'
    }).then(function(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });
    ```

    ## CORS

    Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a robust W3C specification for
    allowing browsers to access resources from different domains. LCBO API uses
    it to give access to web browser JavaScript applications.

    If you need to support outdated bowsers,
    [specifically IE 6 and 7](http://caniuse.com/#feat=cors), you'll either have
    to use a proxy or JSONP. Hilariously, with the advent of async script tags
    `<script async>` JSONP can be about as effective in modern browsers as
    using XMLHttpRequest with CORS. If you have to support older browsers that
    don't understand CORS, there is no shame in using JSONP.

    If you don't have to support IE 6 and 7, _welcome to the future!_ To use CORS
    with LCBO API you need to provide an Web Browser Access Key with your
    requests. You'll need an LCBO API account to create Access Keys,
    [sign up](/sign-up) for one and get started. You can also
    [read more](#authentication) about LCBO API authentication.

    Once you have a Web Browser Access Key, using LCBO API with CORS from jQuery
    is as simple as:

    ```javascript
    $.ajax({
      url: 'http://lcboapi.com/products/346197',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Token YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
      }
    }).then(function(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });
    ```

- anchor: 'pagination'
  title: 'Pagination'
  body: |
    # Pagination

    When the API returns collections of items (stores, products, or inventories)
    it will paginate the results. You can control the number of items per page
    through the `per_page` parameter.

    A typical pager object looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "records_per_page": 20,
      "total_record_count": 608,
      "current_page_record_count": 20,
      "is_first_page": false,
      "is_final_page": false,
      "current_page": 5,
      "current_page_path": "/stores?page=5",
      "next_page": 6,
      "next_page_path": "/stores?page=6",
      "previous_page": 4,
      "previous_page_path": "/stores?page=4",
      "final_page": 31,
      "final_page_path": "/stores?page=31"
    }
    ```

    It contains all of the information you need (and more) to navigate through
    the pages in the result set.
- anchor: 'csv'
  title: 'CSV Data'
  body: |
    # CSV and TSV Responses

    Many resources can be returned as CSV (comma separated values) or TSV
    (tab separated values). These results can then be easily imported into
    spreadsheet software such as Apple Numbers or Microsoft Excel. To return
    a resource in CSV or TSV format simply append the `.csv` or `.tsv`
    extension to the resource URI:

    <pre><code>/products<em>.csv</em>?order=price_in_cents.desc
    </code></pre>
- anchor: 'errors'
  title: 'Errors'
  body: |
    # Errors

    When an error occurs the response will look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      "error": "bad_query_error",
      "message": "A value supplied for the order parameter (id.desk) is not valid. It contains an invalid sort order (desk) for (id) try using: id.desc or id.asc instead.",
      "result": null,
      "status": 400
    }
    ```

    Error messages are always as descriptive as possible and they fall into one
    of the below categories:

    | Code               | Description                                         |
    | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
    | `no_results_error` | The geocoder returned no geometry for the geo query. |
    | `over_limit_error` | The geocoder has reached its daily limit of requests. |
    | `geocoder_error`   | The geocoder can't geocode the query it was provided. |
    | `not_found_error`  | A resource was not found (404) |
    | `bad_query_error`  | One (or more) of the supplied query parameters is wrong. |
    | `jsonp_error`      | Supplied callback is not a valid format, or JSONP is not being used correctly. |
    | `unauthorized`     | The feature you're trying to use requires an Access Key |
