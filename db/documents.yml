    The goal of LCBO API is to provide developers and hobbyists with a way to
    create intelligent applications that take advantage of the unique benefits
    that come from having a single provider of alcoholic beverages in a large
    geographical area.

    ### Backstory

    LCBO API was created by me, [Carsten Nielsen](http://heycarsten.com), I'm a
    software developer from [Unspace Interactive](http://unspace.ca) in
    Toronto, Canada. I built LCBO API from the ground up using my favourite
    tools, you can read more about that in the [FAQ](/docs/faq).

    How LCBO API came to be is sort of a convoluted story. I had purchased a
    book called The 500 Best-Value Wines in the LCBO by Rod Phillips. I would
    often take the book with me to my neighbourhood LCBO where I would select
    a wine from the book, then search the shelves for it. I would repeat this
    process until I selected a wine that was in stock.

    I quickly figured that it would be easier to look the product up on the
    LCBO website and scan to see if it was available at the store. Using
    lcbo.com on my iPhone was very cumbersome though, and I found it faster to
    just scan the shelves. This was not good enough -- I needed something
    better!

    I decided I would create an iPhone app that allowed me to see if my
    neighbourhood LCBO carried a certain product. The first step to creating
    this application was to build an API where it could draw data from.
    Fast-forward many evenings of spare time to May 1st, 2009 and the first
    version of lcboapi.com was live. Over the next few months of spare time
    I added more useful features to the API and added documentation.

    Developers started to contact me, primarily interested to use the API to
    create apps for mobile devices. After Taylan Pince released
    [Liquor, ON](http://hippofoundry.com/lcbo/) (then named: LCBO) I
    decided to focus my efforts entirely on the API and leave the applications
    to other developers.

    ### Usage

    The API is primarily designed to provide JSON data directly to mobile and
    web applications, but it is also capable of returning CSV data to be used
    directly in a spreadsheet application.

    Here are some examples of real-world applications:

     * [LCBO Search](http://lcbosearch.com) by Carsten Nielsen [Web App]
     * [Liquor, ON](http://hippofoundry.com/lcbo/) by Taylan Pince [iPhone App]

    If you plan on performing hundreds of queries per second for uses such as
    data analysis then you should download the latest [dataset](/docs/dataset)
    and perform these operations offline. The datasets contain CSV data, if
    you need a different format please ask.

    ### Contact

    I would love to hear about how you are using the data or API. I would also
    love to hear from you if you want to do something with the data but are not
    sure how to get started. You can reach me through
    [Twitter](http://twitter.com/heycarsten), and by
    [email](mailto:heycarsten@gmail.com).

    ### CSV and TSV Responses

    Many resources can be returned as CSV (comma separated values) or TSV
    (tab separated values). These results can then be easily imported into
    spreadsheet software such as Apple Numbers or Microsoft Excel. To return
    a resource in CSV or TSV format simply append the `.csv` or `.tsv` extension
    to the resource URI:

    <pre><code>/products<em>.csv</em>?order=price_in_cents.desc
    </code></pre>

    ### JSON Responses

    Every response from the API is wrapped in a "container" that in its most
    basic form looks like this:

        {
          "status": 200,
          "message": null,
          "result": ...
        }

    This allows the API to return meta information along with the data you are
    requesting. For example, in the case of a Stores with Product request the
    product object is returned with list of stores so that your application does
    not need to perform two requests.

    ### Errors

    When an error occurs the response will look like this:

        {
          "error": "bad_query_error",
          "message": "A value supplied for the order parameter (id.desk) is not valid. It contains an invalid sort order (desk) for (id) try using: id.desc or id.asc instead.",
          "result": null,
          "status": 400
        }

    Error messages are always as descriptive as possible; one of the design
    goals for LCBO API is to make experiential learning (learning by trial and
    error) as easy as possible. There are a few different types of errors:

     * `no_results_error`: The geocoder returned no geometry for the geo query.
     * `over_limit_error`: The geocoder has reached its daily limit of requests.
     * `geocoder_error`: The geocoder can't geocode the query it was provided.
     * `not_found_error`: A resource was not found (404)
     * `bad_query_error`: One (or more) of the supplied query parameters is wrong.
     * `jsonp_error`: Supplied callback is not a valid format.

    ### Pagination

    When the API returns collections of items (stores, products, or inventories)
    it will paginate the results. You can control the number of items per page
    through the `per_page` parameter.

    A typical pager object looks like this:

        {
          "records_per_page": 20,
          "total_record_count": 608,
          "current_page_record_count": 20,
          "is_first_page": false,
          "is_final_page": false,
          "current_page": 5,
          "current_page_path": "/stores?page=5",
          "next_page": 6,
          "next_page_path": "/stores?page=6",
          "previous_page": 4,
          "previous_page_path": "/stores?page=4",
          "final_page": 31,
          "final_page_path": "/stores?page=31"
        }

    It contains all of the information you need (and more) to navigate through
    the pages in the result set.

    ### JSON-P

    JSON-P stands for "JSON with padding" which is a very confusing way of
    saying JSON wrapped in a Javascript function call; I like to think of it as
    JSON-JS. It is used to circumvent browser security limitations when trying
    to access resources via Javascript from a different host than the containing
    page. That means you can use it to load LCBO API resources on a page that is
    not hosted on lcboapi.com, such as your website!

    One of the limitations to JSON-P is that the HTTP status can not be properly
    set to an error level because the `<script>` element that is dynamically
    written to the page will fail to load. Because of this all JSON-P requests
    return a 200 HTTP status code, regardless of the actual status. However, the
    `"status"` node in the response container always indicates the real status.

    To use JSON-P simply provide a `callback` parameter to your query. For
    example, to search products and return JSON-P you would request:

    <pre><code>/products?q=cider&<em>callback=</em>setJSON
    </code></pre>

    This will return the normal JSON response but wrap it in a function call:

    <pre><code><em>setJSON(</em>{"status":200, "message":null, "response": ...}<em>);</em>
    </code></pre>

    You can optionally specify a `.js` file extension for the resource, but the
    `Content-Type` header will always be set to `text/javascript` when returning
    JSON-P. For example the following request URI is the same as the one above.

    <pre><code>/products<em>.js</em>?q=cider&callback=setJSON
    </code></pre>


- :title: Frequently Asked Questions
  :menu: FAQ
  :body: |
    ### Is it free?

    Absolutely! There is no desire or intention to charge for the use of the
    API. I only ask that you tell me about what you are making with it. It costs
    roughly $50/month to host the project,
    [donations](http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/8126) are greatly appreciated!

    ### Where does the data come from?

    Why, from the LCBO of course! Their website is periodically crawled to get
    up-to-date information. Search engines like Google and Bing use this same
    technique to index web pages.

    ### Why did you do this?

    I feel that publicly available information should be free and accessible in
    as many ways as possible. I want to see what individuals will do with this
    information when presented with it in an accessible format... and I wanted
    an LCBO app for my iPhone. Read the [about section](/docs/about) for more
    information.

    ### Can you add barcode information products, please?

    I do not currently have access to barcode information for all products that
    the LCBO stocks. I understand how useful barcode data would be for products
    and if this ever changes it will certainly be announced on
    [@lcboapi](http://twitter.com/lcboapi)'s Twitter account.

    ### Can you add product images, please?

    I do not have a reliable source for product images, the best bet is to use
    Google Image Search API with the full product name and hope that the first
    result is relevant, it is often not.

    ### Can you add YAML as a response format?

    Maybe, but since JSON is a subset of YAML adding it as a response format
    sort of feels like building a house around an perfectly functional, already
    existing house. If enough people want it, I'll add it.

    ### Can you add XML as a response format?

    No. I don't believe in [XML](http://www.json.org/xml.html).

    ### I'm a geek, how does it work?

    * [Ruby 1.9.2](http://tryruby.org)
    * [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com)
    * [Rails 3](http://rubyonrails.org)
    * [Sequel](http://sequel.rubyforge.org)
    * [Redis](http://redis.io)
    * [Postgres](http://postgresql.org)
    * [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main)
    * [Ubuntu 10.04](http://ubuntu.com/server)
    * [Linode](http://linode.com)

    ### Is it open source?

    The [parser](http://github.com/heycarsten/lcbo) is open source, my intention
    is to eventually open source the API service too in the future. Here are
    the current open source contributions:

    * [LCBO](http://github.com/heycarsten/lcbo) - HTML Parser
    * [GCoder](http://github.com/heycarsten/gcoder) - Geocoding
