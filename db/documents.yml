Information:
- :title: Introduction
  :body: |
    LCBO API was created by me, [Carsten Nielsen](http://heycarsten.com),
    a software developer from Toronto, Canada. I built it from the ground up
    using some of my favorite tools, you can read more about those in the
    [FAQ](/docs/faq).
    
    The goal of the service is to provide developers with an easy way to
    create intelligent applications that take advantage of the unique benefits
    that come with having a single provider of alcoholic beverages in a large
    geographical area.
    
    ### Use-Cases
    
    The API is intended to provide data to mobile and web applications, an
    example of such an application is [LCBO Search](http://lcbosearch.com).
    
    If you plan on performing hundreds of queries per second for uses such as
    data analysis then you should download the latest dataset and perform these
    operations offline. [Datasets](/docs/dataset) are made available upon every
    successful crawl and can be downloaded as often as necessary.
    
    ### Contact
    
    I would love to hear about how you are using the data or API. I would also
    love to hear from you if you want to do something with the data but are not
    sure how to get started. You can reach me through
    [Twitter](http://twitter.com/heycarsten), and by
    [email](mailto:heycarsten@gmail.com). Please don't ask me to phone you.

  :menu: FAQ
  :body: |
    ### Is it free?
    
    Absolutely! There is no desire or intention to charge for the use of the
    API. I only ask that you tell me about what you are making with it. It costs
    roughly $50/month to host the project,
    [donations](http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/8126) are very helpful.
    
    ### Where does the data come from?
    
    Why, from the LCBO of course! Their website is periodically crawled to get
    up-to-date information. Search engines like Google use this same technique
    to index web pages.
    
    ### Why did you do this?
    
    I feel that publicly available information should be free and accessible in
    as many ways as possible. I want to see what individuals will do with this
    information when presented with it in an accessible format. And I wanted
    an LCBO app for my iPhone.
    
    ### How does it work?
    
    * [Rails 3](http://rubyonrails.org)
    * [Sequel](http://sequel.rubyforge.org)
    * [Redis](http://redis.io)
    * [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org)
    * [Passenger 3](http://www.modrails.com)
    * [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main)
    * [Linode](http://linode.com)
    
    ### Is it open source?
    
    The [parser](http://github.com/heycarsten/lcbo) is open source, my intention
    is to eventually open source the API service too in the future.
